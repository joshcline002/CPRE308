usleep()
DESCRIPTION
       The usleep() function suspends execution of the calling thread for  (at
       least)  usec microseconds.  The sleep may be lengthened slightly by any
       system activity or by the time spent processing  the  call  or  by  the
       granularity of system timers.

RETURN VALUE
       The  usleep() function returns 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned,
       with errno set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       EINTR  Interrupted by a signal; see signal(7).

       EINVAL usec is not smaller than 1000000.  (On  systems  where  that  is
              considered an error.)
